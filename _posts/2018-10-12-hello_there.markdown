Hello World!

My name is Christina, but my friends call me Chrissy. A little known fact about me, is that I was named after Suzanne Somers from Three’s Company. Yup, I am a child of the 80s. But, enough small talk. This is my inaugural blog post, so naturally I am going to explain how I managed to get here in the first place. 

Circa mid-to-late 2000s, I was trying to decide “What I wanted to be when I grew up.” To be honest, I wanted to pursue my dreams of going to art school, but it was just not in the cards for me. My father was a career counselor at the time and pretty much talked me out of it because the job outlook was not secure and the cost of art school (at least the ones I was thinking about) was intense to say the least. Not to mention, I can be an artist without making it my job. I decided, I didn’t want to make art my job, because I felt it would limit me by only creating content to meet the needs of advertising, but I digress. 

I knew I was good with science, math, and people. Because of this, I decided I would be a nurse. While I loved learning about medical terminology, diagnosis, treatments, interventions, and diagnostics; I realized very quickly that when I hit the floor I was absolutely not cut out to do nursing for a long time. My anxiety climbed to unforeseeable heights knowing someone’s life was literally in my hands every day. Fast forward a few years, I was lucky enough to find myself in a telecommuting nurse position.

At this point in my career and life I found myself intersecting more and more with technology. It just came with the territory of my career. Thankfully this is the part of my work that I enjoy immensely. I have always enjoying working with technology, since I was younger. When I was still in middle school, our computer would break at home. My father always blamed me for breaking it, so naturally I had to figure out out to fix things. Again to my luck, my uncle from New York was an engineer who frequently worked with computers. 

I would spend hours on the phone with him, ruling out issues, replacing parts, and doing diagnostics on my family’s desktop. By the time I left for college,  I must have opened up my computer ten times to replace parts. It was a good experience though and I am thankful I had him as a resource. Since then, I have replaced hardware on laptops, cellphones, and even my Apple watch. 

Now, as I move into this new chapter in my life, my husband and I are both looking for a change of pace. We had toyed with the thought of learning code, as there is so much potential with this skill. Having always been a creator, I personally believe that learning coding is like learning how to use a new medium on an entirely different canvas. It’s also a tool box that can help solve problems. From a visionary’s perspective, there is nearly unlimited potential. 

So, we made the plunge. My husband and I are working together, completing the self paced software engineering program at FlatIron School. So far, its been nice to be able to go over solutions with him by my side. It’s also been helpful that we can empathize with each other over each of these labs! I am excited about the next several months of the program and I look forward to continually learning and problem solving. 

Until next time - C
